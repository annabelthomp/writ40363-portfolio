     <h3>Academic and Professional Goals!</h3>
    <p>My goal for this class is to take my time with each assignment and fully understand each step I am doing. I can be a slow learner sometimes, however I want to focus on mastering this content for future use. As for my career goals, I hope to one day work in social media marketing or the entertainment industry. Since I also enjoy Real Estate, I would also be interested in potentially working on the marketing side of a Real Estate agency or something in that realm. </p>

    I hope that by the end of this course, I feel very confident with my coding skills. I also hope to be able to easily code without looking back at notes I have written myself.
