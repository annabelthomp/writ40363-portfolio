                <h1>About Me</h1>
             <p> My name is Annabel Thompson and I am a Strategic Communication major with a minor in Film and Media Studies & Digital Culture and Data Analytics at Texas Christian University, graduating in 2027. I am originally from St. Louis, Missouri however attended boarding school in Simsbury, Connecticut for the last 2 years of high school.</p>

            <p> I’m passionate about how brands connect with audiences and the role creativity plays in building strong relationships. My coursework and projects have given me hands-on experience in digital marketing, product advertising, and media strategy, helping me approach communication from both a creative and strategic perspective. </p>

        
           <p>  I’m driven by curiosity and love solving problems through storytelling and design. Whether it’s creating accessible web experiences, building campaigns, or experimenting with new media, I’m always looking for ways to blend creativity with functionality.</p>
           
        <p>  In the future, I hope to work in a dynamic environment where I can develop impactful campaigns, explore digital innovation, and grow as a communicator. Outside of school and work, I value meaningful connections, collaboration, and finding inspiration in everyday experiences. </p>
