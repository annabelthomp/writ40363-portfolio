<h2>About Me!</h2>
    My name is Annabel Thompson and I am a Junior Strategic Communication major from St. Louis, MO. I also am double minoring in Film and Media Studies, as well as Digital Culture and Data Analytics.</p>

<p>Although I am originally from St. Louis, MO, I attended boarding school in Simsbury, Connecticut for my last 2 years of highschool. I have 2 older sisters as well as 2 dogs at home. In my free time, I enjoy going on walks, trying new restaurants, and being with friends and family. 

<p>I believe I am good at problem solving and figuring out what I can do to find success, whether this be in a school or personal setting. I am learning to stay on track with tasks and manage multiple issues at once. </p>
 <p> Something that drives me is my family and my passions. I strive to succeed not only for myself but for my family as well. I love finding success in everything I do and seeing what works best for me. What drives my curiosity is others and seeing what sorts of things are possible whether this be academic work or fun creative ideas in my personal life!
<h3> Goals!</h3>
<p>My goals for this course are to stay on top of my work and not fall behind. I also hope to become very well versed with the different coding platforms being used and learn how to use them without needing help. Beyond this class, my goals for this year are to achieve a successful GPA and learn more through my major/minor based courses. </p>
<p>Here is a funny video I found on YouTube!</p>
