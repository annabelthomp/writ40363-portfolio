     <h2>About Me!</h2>
    My name is Annabel Thompson and I am a Junior Strategic Communication major from St. Louis, MO. I also am double minoring in Film and Media Studies, as well as Digital Culture and Data Analytics.</p>
<!-- the next paragraph has bold text  -->

    <p>Although I am originally from St. Louis, MO, I attended boarding school in Simsbury, Connecticut for my last 2 years of highschool. I have 2 older sisters as well as 2 dogs at home. In my free time, I enjoy going on walks, trying new restaurants, and being with friends and family. 

 <p>A fun fact about me is that I love Real Estate and scroll on Zillow in my free time. </p>
 <p> Something that drives me is my family and my passions. I strive to succeed not only for myself but for my family as well. I love finding success in everything I do and seeing what works best for me.

    <p>Here is a funny video I found on YouTube!</p>
