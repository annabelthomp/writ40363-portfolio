# Project Zed: AI-Assisted Web Application

## Overview

This project is part of **WRIT 40363: Digital Communication Design & Analysis** and represents the culmination of skills developed throughout the semester. Project Zed focuses on **upskilling through AI collaboration**—taking foundational web development techniques from Projects 1-3 and pushing them further with AI as a development partner.

The goal is to build an ambitious web application that demonstrates technical growth, critical thinking, and effective AI collaboration. This project emphasizes the learning journey over perfection, documenting both successes and struggles along the way.
