# Project Zed: AI-Assisted Web Application

## Overview

This project is part of **WRIT 40363: Digital Communication Design & Analysis** and represents the culmination of skills developed throughout the semester. Project Zed focuses on **upskilling through AI collaboration**—taking foundational web development techniques from Projects 1-3 and pushing them further with AI as a development partner.

The goal is to build an ambitious web application that demonstrates technical growth, critical thinking, and effective AI collaboration. This project emphasizes the learning journey over perfection, documenting both successes and struggles along the way.

## Project Description

**Event Countdown Timer** is an interactive web application that helps users track and count down to important life events in real-time. Whether it's a birthday, wedding, graduation, or project deadline, this app provides visual countdowns with persistent storage, a calendar view, and optional browser notifications—solving the problem of losing track of upcoming events in our busy lives while demonstrating advanced web development techniques including real-time updates, local storage, the Notification API, theme toggling, and responsive design.

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

### Frameworks & Libraries
[TODO: List any additional libraries or APIs you're using, such as:
