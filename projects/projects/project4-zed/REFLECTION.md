For my last project, I built an Event Countdown Timer web application designed to help users track important upcoming dates so they never miss meaningful moments. The app lets users add custom events with a name, date, time, and optional description, and then view them on the main events page or in a calendar format. I chose this project because I wanted to create something practical, visually clean, and user-focused, something that felt like a real product rather than a basic coding exercise. This project allowed me to combine interaction design, JavaScript logic, and layout organization in ways that felt authentic to modern web development, all while using AI. 
Throughout the process, I upskilled and deepened many abilities I first learned in Projects 1 through 3. The earliest projects taught me the fundamentals of HTML structure, CSS styling, and basic JavaScript functionality, but this project challenged me to push those skills further. I became more confident in managing form data, validating user inputs, handling optional fields, and dynamically updating the interface based on the user’s actions. The logic behind adding, storing, and displaying events required more careful planning than earlier assignments, and working with dates pushed me into more complex territory with parsing, comparison, and time-based calculations. I also strengthened my understanding of UI flow, thinking more critically about what the user sees at each step, including helpful blank-state messaging and intuitive navigation into the calendar view.
AI played a significant role in influencing my development process. In earlier projects, I tended to get stuck on small errors or spend too much time writing repetitive boilerplate. This time, AI acted almost like a development partner: helping scaffold layout structures, suggesting clearer ways to organize event data, and offering debugging assistance when I hit walls. It accelerated the repetitive parts of coding and freed me to focus on the conceptual, creative, and functional decisions that actually make the project feel polished. At the same time, I discovered that AI-generated code is not flawless. Some suggestions were incomplete, or did not fully match the logic I needed, or introduced subtle bugs that required me to slow down and rethink the solution. That was actually one of the most surprising parts of working with AI, the realization that I needed to engage critically with its suggestions rather than copy them blindly. It forced me to understand the code at a deeper level, which ultimately improved my skills.
If I built this project again, I would focus on refining and expanding the functionality. I would improve the calendar view to make it more interactive, incorporate persistent storage so events save across sessions, and enhance the date-handling logic so countdowns feel more human and dynamic. I would also strengthen accessibility and responsiveness to ensure the layout works smoothly across all screen sizes. Finally, I would integrate actual browser notifications, turning the “Enable Notifications” option into a real reminder system.
Completing this project significantly increased my confidence as a developer. It showed me that I can take an idea, break it into steps, combine multiple skills, and build something functional that users can understand and enjoy. I now feel more comfortable approaching complex problems and more capable of using AI as a helpful but not controlling tool. This project made me feel like a more independent, creative, and capable developer, and I can see that growth clearly in the finished product.
